          <h4>Single Value Panels</h4>
          Top three panels answer to the question:
          <pre>- What is my computer's current average CPU load?</pre>
          The ranges that influance the background color are defined as follows:
          <br />
          <span className="has-background-success-light">[0%, 60%]</span>,{' '}
          <span className="has-background-warning-light">(60%, 100%]</span> and{' '}
          <span className="has-background-danger-light">(100%, +&infin;)</span>.
        </p>
        <h4>Time Series Panel</h4>
        <p>
          The panel in the second row answers the question:{' '}
          <pre>

          defined at the same thresholds as SVP panels. New data points show up
          every 10 seconds.

        <h4>Data Table Panel</h4>
        <p>
          The panel in the last row lists down all <i>Incidents</i> and gives
          answers to the questions:
          <pre>
            - Has my computer been under heavy CPU load for 2 minutes or more?
            When? How many times? <br />- Has my computer recovered from heavy
            CPU load? When? How many times?
          </pre>
          An <i>Incident</i> can be thought of as a time range when CPU was
          fully under high average load for at least 2 minutes. If its right
          boundary is defined, it means that at least 2 consecutive minutes
          after it the CPU load was under 100% load (it recovered) â€” its status
          is <span className="has-text-success">resolved</span>. If the right
          boundary is undefined, it means the CPU is still under heavy load and
          its status is <span className="has-text-danger">ongoing</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
    </PanelBody>
  </Panel>
